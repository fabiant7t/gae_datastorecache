DatastoreCache
--------------
    A key value cache persisted by the datastore offering a compatible subset
    of memcache API methods.

Intention:
----------
    I stored the result of some expensive requests using the memcache API,
    which might (and does) expire sometime. To not compute everything again,
    I wrote the datastore cache to also persist the results on BigTable.
    Using a decorator I have a two layer cache that is also helpful while
    App Engine's scheduled maintenance periods where memcache is disabled
    and returns None and BigTable is in read-only mode.

Usage:
------
    gae_datastorecache.models.DatastoreCache exposes the following API methods
    that are compatible with the google.appengine.api.memcache methods:
    (See http://tinyurl.com/appengine-memcache-functions for details)

    * add
    * delete
    * get
    * flush_all
    * replace
    * set

Tests:
------
    Have a look at the tests.py, it covers the whole code.
